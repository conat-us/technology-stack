Description of the Conatus technology stack and strategy

# Introduction

The Conatus product line will be implemented with technologies and libraries provided by or built upon the Microsoft .NET platform or compatible with the same.

# Application Development Language

C# will be used as the application development language for Conatus, due to its modernity and productivity. The version of the language selected will be the latest version of the language supported by the underlying .NET platform. For .NET 5 this will be C# version 9. For .NET 6 this will be C# version 10.

# .NET Platform

In late 2021 through to March 2022, all development of Conatus will take place using .NET 5. This is because all of the tooling associated with .NET 5 is mature and stable.

The Conatus product line will be re-platformed to .NET 6 in late March or early April 2022. This will coincide with the launch (by Microsoft) of a stable and full-featured version of Visual Studio 2022 for Mac. The rationale for this is that software development will take place on MacBook Pros and iMac workstations. The latest Visual Studio 2022 for Mac is in Beta only and is still relatively unusable.

# Development Tools

The following development tools will be used for software development of Conatus:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (through to late March/April 2022) 32-bit
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (from April 2022) 64-bit

Either Mac or Windows versions or Visual Studio are permissible since the software is highly consistent across platforms for the features of the .NET platform that Conatus will use.

# Data Persistence

The Conatus product line is suitable for use with a relational data model and an object relational mapping framework (ORM). 

## Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

The ORM product that will be used for the Conatus product line will be Microsoft's Entity Framework Core. This ORM isolates application developers - at least to a large extent - from the details of the underlying database product. In other words, the semantics of CRUD operations from an application developer's standpoint are dictated by the ORM product rather than the dialect of SQL used by the underlying relational database management system. This means that the application development team can develop business logic that has a dependency on the ORM framework with the added benefit that the underlying database product can be swapped for another at a later date with relatively little impact.

Development of the Conatus product line will be based upon Entity Framework Core version 5 until late March/April 2022. From April 2022 Entity Framework Core version 6 will be used. This transition will coincide with the adoption of .NET 6 and the Visual Studio 2022.

## Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

Entity Framework Core comes with out of the box support for the following relational database products:

- SQLite
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- Microsoft SQL Server

All of these are excellent relational database products. SQLite is unique within this group because it can be embedded in a product and run entirely within memory, whereas the other relational database management systems are all database servers.

Development of the Conatus product line will use two database products:

SQLite will be used for initial development of new features and development of unit tests where data persistence and retrieval is required using Entity Framework Core. The reason for this is that SQLLite can be run in memory and is very, very fast. As a result, automated build times that incorporate unit testing in the Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline are able to run quickly and are not prone to failing due to stale test data that was persisted on a remote database server.

The production relational database will be PosgreSQL. The selection of this product is due to its scalability, maturity and ubiquity. PostgreSQL is offered by virtually all Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) vendors, is cost effective (being cheaper than other proprietary products), is well supported (with skills being readily available), is ideally suited to native deployment on Linux distributions (with which it is usually shipped as standard), is robust, reliable, scalable and enterprise grade. Furthermore, enhanced relational database products (such as AWS Aurora) are based upon and compatible with PostgreSQL syntax.

# Graphical User Interface Technologies

The Conatus product line will, by default, be progressive web applications (PWAs) using Blazor WebAssembly technology. PWAs provide most of the benefits of native applications but are more portable. At a later stage,  versions of selected applications from the Conatus product line may be made available as native applications. This may be useful where Conatus believes there is a significant advantage in exploiting platform-specific app stores for iOS and Android.

## Development with Blazor

New product features will, as a general rule, be developed using Blazor server technology. This is because developing new features with Blazor Server permits easier and more rapid debugging. Porting the debugged code to Blazor WebAssembly is relatively trivial and quick. 

Blazor server apps are not suitable for deployment to production on the public Internet, however. Production versions of applications will always be implemented with WebAssembly.

### Component Kits

The Conatus product line will use the Blazorise component kit. This supports a number of CSS frameworks including Bootstrap and Material UI.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

The Conatus product line will, by default, use Bootstrap as its default CSS framework for styling of Blazor components.

## Development with Multi-platform App UI (MAUI)

Where native applications are required, these will be developed using Blazor and MAUI.

## Back Office Applications

So-called "Back Office" applications used by administrators (rather than customers or staff in the field) may initially use Razor components rather than Blazor components. These may be conventional web applications rather than progressive web applications implemented as single page applications (SPAs).

The justification for this is that many mature and stable out-of-the-box applications and frameworks are available that do not yet use Blazor as a GUI rendering technology. Using these applications and frameworks makes sense for administration functions which tend to be performed on a workstation rather than a mobile device.

Back Office applications of this type may include Content Management Systems (CMS) and or frameworks that are used to configure back end services.

# Content Management

Content Management (including internationalisation) will be implemented with Orchard Core CMS. Orchard Core CMS is built with .NET (originally .NET Core) and is an excellent web content management system that permits integration of web application components and services.

Blazor applications will consume content from the Orchard Core CMS using Orchard Core CMS as a headless or decoupled CMS. This means that content will be consumed via web services surfaced by the Orchard Core CMS rather than built directly into Blazor web applications themselves.

This content management implementation strategy leverages mature CMS technology (which is highly performant) and leverages Orchard Core's multi-tenancy capabilities to manage content on a per-customer basis (either as a managed service or on a self-service basis). This is the most flexible way of accommodating internationalization (i18n) of business text, static artwork and multi-media files.

# Workflow Management

Workflow management will be implemented with Orchard Core framework. Note that this is included within Orchard Core CMS and can be part of the same back office server process.

Orchard Core CMS ships with a built-in workflow designer. Custom workflow tasks can be implemented in C# as .NET modules.

# Module system

Larger and more sophisticated applications should be built with a module system. This permits parallel development, development by third parties, the use of optional features and customized behaviour using module parameters and settings. The Conatus product line is likely to grow to be a sophisticated SaaS offering with new features being added over time and new integration points with offerings from third party vendors. Packaging integration points within optional modules is an excellent means of making Conatus relevant to a wider audience without detracting from business value that the Conatus product line itself brings to the enterprise.

## Candidate Application Frameworks

There are a number of application frameworks for .NET that implement module systems. These include:

- Orchard Core framework
- ABP framework
- Oqtane framework

## Comparison of .NET Application Frameworks

Both ABP framework and Orchard Core framework are mature. ABP framework, however, is quite invasive: it requires inheritance or direct dependency on ABP classes and interfaces. An inevitable consequence of this is very tight (and inflexible) coupling between the ABP framework and the application that is implemented with it. Orchard Core, on the other hand, can be used with minimal dependencies on Orchard Core classes and interfaces themselves.

ABP supports development with Blazor whereas Orchard Core has no direct support for Blazor. However, Orchard Core modules can contain anything at all, including Blazor WebAssembly modules and corresponding back end services. The Orchard Core CMS ships with the Orchard Core framework and can be integrated very easily with user interfaces built with Blazor. Multiple Blazor apps can be packaged as Orchard Core Modules.

Both ABP and Orchard Core have built-in support for multi-tenancy.

Oqtane is a promising framework with built-in support for multi-tenancy and Blazor. However, the framework is relatively immature and the documentation is completely inadequate at the time of writing. It is not, therefore, suitable for adoption in a production application.

## Conclusion

None of the application frameworks is ideal. However, the framework that best combines the features that are likely to be most relevant to the Conatus product line is Orchard Core. It's well-documented, mature, fast and demands few compromises from application developers. The lack of direct support for Blazor isn't likely to present any problems. A huge benefit, though, is provision of an extensible web CMS that's built upon the underlying Orchard Core module system and that provides a rapid means of implementing a really useful and useable internationalised "Back Office" application platform.

Conatus applications aimed at consumers or operational staff in the field (be these engineers, sales representatives or delivery drivers) can be implemented with Blazor and consume services and content from the multi-tenancy "Back Office" platform. Each tenant - a corporate customer using the Conatus platform - can use, configure and pay for different modules to extend and integrate the Contatus product line with offerings from third parties or services that exist (or are planned) within the corporate customer's own enterprise systems.

Using a strategy that provisions lightweight Blazor WebAssembly single page progressive web apps (ideal for use on mobile devices or in vehicles) and more heavyweight CMS-backed "Back Office" apps (that themselves come with features like workflow management) that, via optional modules, leverage Conatus product line features to enhance (or that can be enhanced by) third party or corporate services (or a mixture thereof) is likely to:

- bring the Conatus product line to market sooner with a more complete product offering
- permit a wider range of Conatus product line offerings with the least amount of development time and risk
- make the Conatus product line more relevant and useful to a wider range of (paying) corporate customers
- reduce the size of apps that target consumers and staff in the field, which makes for faster loading times and reduced load on mobile device batteries, memory and processing power - which tends to lead to "snappier" app performance and a better and more focussed user experience

# Package Management

The Package Manager for the Conatus product line will be Microsoft's Nuget packaging system. Nuget packages may be hosted on public and private repositories (including within the local file system of the developer's machine).

Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 both have excellent support for package management using Nuget.

# Runtime Containers

The runtime container system that will be used is Docker. The rationale for this is that Docker and its associated tooling is well understood by the wider development community. Docker Hub is an excellent and convenient container image repository that can be monetised by vendors. 

During development on Mac machines, Docker Desktop is an excellent and convenient tool to use.

# Container Orchestration

Initial development of container orchestration will be based upon Docker Compose. A key benefit of Docker Compose is that it's very easy to understand and tooling already exists to deploy Docker Compose stacks onto Kubernetes-based orchestration engines and services.

In future container orchestration may use Kubernetes with Helm. This is more flexible and more powerful than Docker Compose but - at least at the outset - Docker Compose is easier to understand for most developers and easier to set up and run in a local development environment.

# CI/CD Pipeline

As a new suite of products, the Conatus product line will use GitHub Actions to build a CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions is a relatively recent enhancement to GitHub that provides similar CI/CD facilities to other CI/CD pipelines. But in this case they're all integrated directly into GitHub itself. 

This integration is beneficial since no integration of an external CI/CD pipeline is necessary. But furthermore, GitHub Marketplace provides additional products and integrations that can be used to enhance and extend the CI/CD pipeline itself.

The target of a build can be deployed to any IaaS provider, including AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

# Issue Management

Issue Management will be performed using GitHub integrated Issue Management. This provides similar (if basic) functionality equivalent to tools like Atlassian JIRA but is perfectly adequate for issue management and tracking. But with the added benefit that it's highly integrated with the GitHub platform itself and provides a means of automating many tasks (including tracking of builds and deployments).

# Software Repositories

GitHub is the most popular software repository platform with a wide range of enhanced services, extension points and integration points. This is the natural home for any software product line that intends to appeal to a corporate IT audience that intends to integrate that product line with other services provided by its own enterprise systems or third parties.

Some elements of the Conatus product line are likely to be open source. This is particularly true of any features that promote integration or adoption, including by third party developers. 

It's strongly suggested that software repositories of this type (along with documentation) are published as public GitHub repositories while proprietary elements of the Conatus product line should be hosted in private GitHub repositories. Use of AWS CodeCommit is strongly discouraged because it provides none of these features and strengths and, in truth, is a very poor alternative to GitHub in amost every respect.

# Identity Management and Authentication

From the outset the Conatus product line will use OAuth2 for authorization and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication. This strategy readily promotes outsourcing of authentication (and related security issues, including multi-factor authentication) to third party identity providers such as Social Media Identity Providers (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and SaaS identity providers (such as OAuth0 and Okta). 

Where Contatus or a client wishes to host their own Identity Provider (such as a corporate Active Directory server or products such as IdentityServer4 or Keycloak server) then this is merely a matter of configuration rather than implementing a custom Identity Provider within the Conatus product line itself.

Support for OAuth2 and OIDC is built into Orchard Core framework out-of-the-box.

# Roles and Permissions

Roles and permissions will be implemented with Microsoft Identity Framwork. This is built into Orchard Core framework out-of the box.
